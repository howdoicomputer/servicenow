## servicenow

Import package:

```    import "github.com/josh5276/servicenow"```

Forked from the original package built by [Andrew Stuart](https://github.com/andrewstuart/servicenow), 
the servicenow package is an extension and maintained project for interactions with the Service Now JSONv2
API interface.


Package servicenow currently provides primarily low-level abstractions for
communicating with the ServiceNow API, and data types useful for unmarshaling
the nonstandard JSON types that ServiceNow returns (e.g. non-ISO datetime
format). As needs arise, higher-level abstractions may be added that provide
easy access to standard structured objects in the ServiceNow API, for example a
method to easily access structs representing change requests.
